# Goal: 
We wan to help  commercial crab farmers to known the right age of their  crabs. This will help  them decide if and when to harvest the crabs. Beyond a certain age, there is negligible growth in crab's physical characteristics and hence, it is important to time the harvesting to reduce cost and increase profit. 

Also, we want to understand the different physical feature changes with age.
